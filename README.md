# Ladybugger

You are Lady Felyne, a lone warrior traveling through hostile territory, at the beginning of a long and dangerous mission. In this episode, you must cross a cobblestone path full of enemy soldiers. Your refuge is the alligator-infested river on the other side. (Let's hope you're a quick swimmer.)

## How to Run Ladybugger

1. Unzip the files inside the game folder, and open the unzipped folder to see the list of files.
2. Right-click on the index.html file, select "Open with...", and click on Google Chrome (or your browser of choice).
3. Your browser will launch, with the Ladybugger game field displayed in the browser window.

Note: This game has only been tested in Google Chrome on a Windows 10 system. If you have trouble running the game, please contact me (see "Contact" section below), and make sure to include the name of the browser you attempted to run the game in, your operating system, and the version numbers of each.

## How to Play Ladybugger

In this guide, your player will be referred to as "Player," and the enemy bugs will be referred to as "Enemies."

### Beginning the Game

Player's starting location is the bottom center of the game field.

Three Enemies will move at varying speeds from left to right across the screen.

Once Enemies leave the right side of the screen, they will repeatedly loop back around to the left and cross again, for the duration of the game.

### Controls

Move Player using the directional keys on your keyboard (left, right, up, and down).  

### Interaction with Enemies

If Player collides with an Enemy as she moves through the game field, Player will be reset back to her starting position.

Enemies will not chase Player.

### Winning the Game

Player wins when she moves safely past the Enemies to the water on the other side.

Upon winning, Player will be reset back to her starting position, and the game will begin again.

## Development Notes

- Seven unique game fields
- Ongoing storyline with multiple on-screen characters
- Player selection, with unique outcome for each
- Increasing difficulty at higher levels
- Score count, with bonus level for high scorers
- Extra lives

Levels will be released as they are completed, with a projected series completion date of December 2017.
